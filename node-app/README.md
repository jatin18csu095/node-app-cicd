Section 1–4 (Assess & Mobilize Phases)
	•	I learned the importance of the Assess Phase, where tools like Migration Evaluator help in cost analysis and building a strong business case.
	•	The Mobilize Phase focuses on preparing the environment with governance, landing zones, and readiness assessments.
	•	Tools like CART (Cloud Adoption Readiness Tool) and MRA (Migration Readiness Assessment) help identify gaps in skills, processes, and security before migration.
	•	I also learned about AWS Systems Manager, CloudWatch, Landing Zone, Control Tower, and Service Catalog which help with governance, monitoring, and managing resources effectively.

Section 5 (Migrate and Modernize Phase)
	•	This section explained the 7 Rs of migration strategies: Rehost, Replatform, Repurchase, Refactor, Relocate, Retain, and Retire. Each application is mapped to one of these strategies depending on business and technical needs.
	•	I learned about Relocate, which is moving VMware workloads directly to AWS without rebuilding.
	•	Rehost (lift and shift) is moving applications as-is to the cloud, usually using AWS Application Migration Service (MGN).
	•	For databases, AWS provides Database Migration Service (DMS) and Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) to migrate both homogeneous and heterogeneous databases.
	•	DMS Fleet Advisor helps discover and analyze database servers before migration.
	•	The course also covered Refactor (redesigning apps for cloud-native benefits), Repurchase (moving to SaaS), Retain (keep as is), and Retire (decommission apps).
