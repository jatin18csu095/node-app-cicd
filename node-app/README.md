=== Q&A Output ===

Q1: How does the message structure for "List of Participants by Discipline" in Cycling BMX Freestyle (Document 1) differ when applied to Cycling BMX Racing as described in Document 2?
A1: In BMX Freestyle, the message emphasizes rider grouping by discipline and presentation order. In BMX Racing, the message structure additionally encodes heat allocations and race seeding information, making the schema more performance-oriented.

Q2: In Document 2, the Event Unit Start List and Results require certain triggers for BMX Racing. How would these triggers apply if adapted for BMX Freestyle as outlined in Document 1?
A2: BMX Racing uses timing gates and lap triggers to initiate results recording. In Freestyle, these would be adapted into routine start/stop triggers tied to judgesâ€™ scoring events instead of lap completions.

Q3: How does the Event Final Ranking message in BMX Racing (Document 2) influence the format and data requirements for a similar message in BMX Freestyle (Document 1)?
A3: Final rankings in BMX Racing include elapsed times, penalties, and positions across heats. For Freestyle, rankings shift toward aggregated judge scores, penalties for execution errors, and trick completion status.

Q4: What are the specific ways the "Applicable Messages" section for BMX Racing (Document 2) alters the permitted use of the Cycling BMX Freestyle Data Dictionary (Document 1)?
A4: Racing requires extensions such as lap time records, heat allocation, and race penalties, which are not defined in the Freestyle data dictionary. These are added as permitted supplemental fields when reusing the base dictionary.

Q5: How does the implementation of the "ExtendedInfo" types in BMX Racing (Document 2) affect the development of BMX Freestyle standards based on guidelines in Document 1?
A5: ExtendedInfo in Racing captures technical timing, weather, and equipment details. In Freestyle, this maps to additional fields for scoring context (e.g., ramp type, trick category, judge panel configuration).
