GIFT Archive is an internal Oracle-based archival system used for compliance and audit reporting of contract data.
It is a homegrown PL/SQL application hosted on Red Hat Enterprise Linux with an Oracle 19c database.
The application is being rehosted (lift-and-shift) to AWS with foundational network and VPC setup in progress.
It has no critical integrations, no high-availability requirements, and minimal business impact on outages.
Future enhancements will include IAM integration, VPC flow monitoring, and automated tagging/patching under the AWS landing zone framework.
