Hi Garnet,

As discussed, we’ve updated the Dev config to DynatraceType: alpine and deployed the changes successfully. We’re able to see the Dynatrace agent associated with the ECS task; screenshots are attached for reference.

Could you please confirm the next steps from your side? Also, when you have a moment, could you review the Dockerfile update (entrypoint integration) and the entrypoint.sh approach we’ve prepared to start OneAgent for the application?

Once confirmed, we’ll proceed with rolling out the remaining changes accordingly.

Thanks.
