1. Rehost (Lift and Shift)

My understanding:
Rehosting means moving applications “as-is” from on-premises to the cloud without making any code changes. The main focus here is speed. Tools like AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) are used to replicate servers into AWS.

Where it is useful:
	•	When the priority is to exit a data center quickly.
	•	When the application works fine as it is and does not immediately need optimization.

Benefits I noted:
	•	Fastest migration option.
	•	Minimal risk since nothing changes in the application.
	•	Low effort required.

2. Replatform (Lift, Tinker, and Shift)

My understanding:
Replatforming involves making small adjustments to an application during migration to take advantage of managed cloud services. For example, instead of hosting a database on EC2, we can move it to Amazon RDS. Or instead of running applications directly on EC2, we can deploy them on Elastic Beanstalk or ECS Fargate.

Where it is useful:
	•	When we want to reduce operational overhead like patching, scaling, and backups.
	•	When we want a balance between quick migration and some optimization.

Benefits I noted:
	•	Removes a lot of management work.
	•	Provides better scalability and availability.
	•	Still requires minimal changes in application code.

3. Refactor (Re-architect for Cloud)

My understanding:
Refactoring is about re-architecting or redesigning the application to make full use of cloud-native features. For example, breaking a monolithic app into microservices, moving some functions into AWS Lambda, or redesigning storage to use S3 + CloudFront. This requires more time and effort compared to rehost or replatform.

Where it is useful:
	•	When we need scalability, agility, and cost optimization in the long run.
	•	When the current architecture limits business growth or flexibility.

Benefits I noted:
	•	Lower cost (e.g., serverless pay-per-use).
	•	Faster development cycles with CI/CD pipelines.
	•	Improved performance and resilience.
