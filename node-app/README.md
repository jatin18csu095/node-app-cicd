3. Application Discovery & Monitoring

Although detailed in later sections, Section 4 introduced me to some of these concepts:
	•	Application Discovery Service (ADS): Collects data about servers, dependencies, and usage. This helps decide which apps are easier or harder to migrate.
	•	Amazon CloudWatch: Used for monitoring performance, logs, and alerts once workloads are on AWS. It plays a critical role in the operational visibility of migrated applications.
	•	AWS Systems Manager: A unified tool to manage resources at scale (patching, automation, compliance, inventory). After migration, this is essential for maintaining cloud hygiene.

4. AWS Governance & Control Services

I also learned that successful migration is not just about moving workloads but also about setting up governance:
	•	AWS Landing Zone: A pre-configured multi-account environment with security, compliance, and logging built in. It’s like setting the foundation before migration begins.
	•	AWS Control Tower: Simplifies the setup of a landing zone with guardrails, account creation, and governance automation.
	•	AWS Service Catalog: Allows organizations to curate and distribute approved IT services (VMs, DBs, applications) so that teams can launch only compliant resources.

5. My Key Takeaways
	•	Migration is a structured journey:
	•	Assess → build the business case and readiness.
	•	Mobilize → prepare governance, security, landing zones.
	•	Then Migrate & Modernize.
	•	Tools like CART, MRA, and MPA are crucial to avoid surprises. They ensure both technology and people are ready.
	•	AWS provides strong governance & monitoring frameworks (Landing Zone, Control Tower, Systems Manager, CloudWatch) that prevent migration chaos and ensure long-term compliance.
	•	From a practical standpoint, I now understand why skipping Assess & Mobilize phases often leads to migration failures—they set the foundation for success.
